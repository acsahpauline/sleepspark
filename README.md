# Sleep Debt Crisis Analysis

Large-scale PySpark analysis of global sleep deprivation using 71 datasets (8GB, 43.5M rows) covering sleep patterns, technology usage, mental health, accidents, and demographics. Identifies root causes of sleep loss, correlates with real-world outcomes including 7.7M+ accidents, and builds ML predictive models for early risk detection. Key findings: 53.7% at high risk, 41.4% with sleep disorders, strong stress-sleep correlation (r=-0.811), healthcare workers and students most affected. Outputs include 30-page technical report, 50+ visualizations, and trained ML models applicable to healthcare screening, corporate wellness, and public policy decisions.
